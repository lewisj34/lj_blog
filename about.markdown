I am a masters student in structural engineering somewhere in the depths of Canada. My interests range from building science and construction, to machine learning and general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). My favourite programming language is C++, but I am comfortable working in python as well. Find me on [Github][github-link] or shoot me an email (contact info at the bottom of the page)!
